            To address the lack of data, we were able to establish a
            large-scale, high-quality annotated dataset within the
            vehicle&apos;s interior, leveraging 3D modeling. Through deep
            learning in artificial intelligence, we developed software aimed at
            estimating the driver&apos;s posture from an image, more accurately
            and reliably than the state of the art, to better understand the
            driver&apos;s condition.
